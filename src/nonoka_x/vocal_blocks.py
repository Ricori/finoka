"""Nonoka X's pinned copy of FineSub's separator block planner.

Cloud vocal separation cuts a track into blocks with the same arithmetic the
local stage uses. Not into the same blocks: ``plan_separation_blocks`` sizes
the count to the worker count, and the cloud always runs one worker while local
runs ``min(profile.vocal_separator_instances, separator_worker_limit(dur))``.
Block edges change the separated audio -- BS-Roformer is chunk-sensitive even
across the pad, which ``plan_separation_blocks`` says outright -- so the two
tracks are equivalent, not identical. What this copy buys is that the cloud's
edges are *upstream's answer for one worker* rather than a rule invented here.

A copy rather than an import, because the cloud Vocal worker cannot import the
stage this comes from: that image carries audio-separator but deliberately no
torchaudio, and ``finesub...separator.separation`` reaches torchaudio through
its audio readers long before it reaches any planning code.

A copy rather than a vendor patch, because the planner is untouched upstream
code. It sits in the one stretch of ``separation.py`` that no patch in
``patches/finesub`` touches, and moving it there would trade forty-five lines
of arithmetic for a file-move hunk that has to be redone against new code at
every upstream sync.

What keeps a copy from drifting is ``tests/test_separator_block_plan.py``: it
compares the block below to the vendored source character for character, and
fails the moment upstream edits it. So keep the block verbatim -- upstream's
names, comments and underscores included. Anything Nonoka X has to say about it
belongs above this line or below the end marker, never inside.

    A fixed core length left every worker a different amount of work and a short
    final block; sizing the count to the workers instead gives each of them the
    same number of equal blocks. The cost is that separated audio now depends on
    the worker count -- block edges move, and Roformer is chunk-sensitive even
    with the pad. That is accepted (docs/gpu-profiles.md), so existing
    ``-vocal.ogg`` files are not reproducible and must be deleted to rerun.

    The ladder in ``separator_worker_limit`` doubles as the guard against
    absurdly short cores, so no separate floor is needed: at one round the core
    is ``duration / workers``, which the 300s ladder bounds below by
    ``300k / (k + 1)`` for ``k`` whole thresholds -- smallest at k=1, i.e. 150s.
    Against a 10s pad per side that is 13% redundant compute at worst.
